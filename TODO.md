* Search mode in main UI, pass to focused panel. Need a nice way to search up/down and highlight as you type.
* Source viewer
  * Navigate include files
* Settings file
  * Sort instances by name or by position in file
  * colors. Need to support white backgrounds I guess
* Polishing
  * Hierarchy "more" expansion shouldn't show up if the "..more.." just hides 1 element.
  * Syntax highlighting of macros
  * Abort search when pressing backspace on an empty string? Matches vim
* Nets should get selected out of the hierarchy panel (no verdi style get without design)
* Different layout for loading waves without source, different hierarchy panel probably.
* Auto-match wave hierarchy against design hierarchy.
* Home and End keys generate a bunch of terminal escaped chars that aren't handled at the moment.
* Search box really should factor out string input into it's own class.

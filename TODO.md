* Source viewer
  * how to show wave values? Bottom bar?
  * Back/forward stack
* Settings file
  * Sort instances by name or by position in file
* Containers with UHDM pointers should all be const
* Polishing
  * Hierarchy "more" expansion shouldn't show up if the "..more.." just hides 1 element.
  * tab/shift-tab should cycle focus too.
